        "content": "MIG welding mild steel is a popular method for joining metal pieces due to its speed and ease of use. This guide covers essential steps and tips for effective MIG welding on mild steel.\n\n**Preparation:**\n- **Clean the Metal:** Ensure that the surfaces are free from rust, paint, or oil. Use a wire brush or grinder if necessary.\n- **Set Up Your Welder:** Connect your gas cylinder to the welder and set it to 75% Argon / 25% Carbon Dioxide (C25) for mild steel. This blend provides good arc stability and penetration while minimizing spatter.\n\n**Welding Process:**\n1. **Tack Welds:** Start by placing tack welds at intervals along the joint to hold pieces in place.\n2. **Adjust Settings:** Use Auto-Set technology if available, or manually set voltage and wire feed speed based on metal thickness. For example:\n   - 24-gauge wire: ~18 volts\n   - 0.023-inch wire: ~22 volts\n3. **Welding Technique:** Maintain a consistent travel speed and keep the torch at a 10-15 degree angle to the workpiece. Use short, controlled movements.\n4. **Post-Weld Cleanup:** Grind down any excess weld material for a smooth finish.\n\n**Safety Tips:**\n- Always wear appropriate PPE including gloves, helmet with proper shade lens, and protective clothing.\n- Ensure good ventilation in your workspace to avoid inhaling fumes.\n",
