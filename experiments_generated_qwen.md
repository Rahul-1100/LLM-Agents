2. **Setup the Circuit**:
   - Connect the anode of the Zener diode to the positive terminal of the variable DC power supply through the current-limiting resistor.
   - Connect the cathode of the Zener diode directly to one end of the load resistor.
   - The other end of the load resistor should connect back to the negative terminal of the power supply, completing the circuit.

3. **Measure Voltage**:
   - Use a voltmeter or multimeter and set it up across the load resistor (between its two ends) to measure the regulated output voltage.

4. **Apply Power and Observe**:
   - Turn on the variable DC power supply.
   - Gradually adjust the input voltage while observing the output voltage measured across the load resistor.
   - Note how the Zener diode maintains a constant regulated output even as the input voltage changes, provided that it remains above the Zener breakdown voltage.

5. **Ensure Safety**:
   - Secure all connections to prevent loose wires or short circuits.
   - After completing the measurements and observations, turn off the power supply and carefully disconnect and disassemble your circuit.

#### Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrates the role of a Zener diode in voltage regulation within a basic electronic setup. By following these steps with safety measures in mind, you can effectively analyze how the Zener diode maintains a constant output voltage across various input voltages.
