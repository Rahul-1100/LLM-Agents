  "content": "### Materials Required\n- Power Supply Unit (PSU)\n- Ammeter\n- Voltmeter\n- Connecting Wires\n- Variable Resistor or Rheostat (Optional, for changing resistance)\n- Conductor Wire (e.g., Nichrome wire)\n- Breadboard (optional, to facilitate connections)\n### Procedure\n1. Set up the circuit by connecting the PSU in series with the ammeter and voltmeter.\n2. Attach one end of the conductor wire (Nichrome wire) to the positive terminal of the power supply unit through an ammeter.\n3. Connect the other end of the conductor to the negative terminal of the PSU via a voltmeter.\n4. If using, connect the variable resistor in series with the circuit for varying resistance during the experiment.\n5. Gradually increase the voltage output from the PSU and record corresponding current values measured by the ammeter and potential difference across the conductor by the voltmeter at each step.\n6. Repeat the process to gather multiple data points, plotting a graph of Voltage (V) against Current (I).\n7. Analyze the graph to confirm if the relationship V = IR holds true for all values."
