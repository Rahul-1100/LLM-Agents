   - Resistors (optional)
   - Input signal source (function generator or variable DC power supply)
   - Multimeter

2. **Circuit Configuration:**
   - Connect the non-inverting input (+) of the LM741 to the input signal.
   - Connect the output of the LM741 directly to its inverting input (-).
   - Power the op-amp with a dual power supply (e.g., ±15V).

3. **Experiment Steps:**
   1. Assemble the circuit on a breadboard or PCB using the components listed above.
   2. Connect the power supply, ensuring correct polarity and voltage limits.
   3. Apply an input signal to the non-inverting input of the LM741.
   4. Measure the output voltage with a multimeter to verify it matches the input (unity gain).
   5. Adjust the input signal as needed to test different conditions.

4. **Safety Precautions:**
   - Ensure all connections are secure before powering the circuit.
   - Use appropriate power supply limits to prevent damage.
   - Double-check polarity of connections, especially for the power supply.
   - Avoid touching the circuit while powered on.
   - Use proper insulation and grounding techniques.
