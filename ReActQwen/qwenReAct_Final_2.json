You will use two function generators to produce different sinusoidal signals.\n3. **BNC Cables**: Coaxial cables used to connect the outputs of the function generators to the inputs of the oscilloscope.\n4. **Power Supply**: To provide power for the function generators and the oscilloscope.\n5. **Screwdrivers or Allen Wrenches** (if needed): For any adjustments on the equipment.\n\n### Experiment Steps\n\n1. **Set Up Equipment**:\n   - Ensure that both the function generators and the oscilloscope are powered on.\n   - Connect one BNC cable from the output of the first function generator to the CH1 input channel of the oscilloscope.\n   - Connect another BNC cable from the output of the second function generator to the CH2 input channel of the oscilloscope.\n\n2. **Generate Sinusoidal Signals**:\n   - Set both function generators to produce sine waves (sinusoidal signals). Adjust the frequencies differently on each generator, for example, 100 Hz on the first and 500 Hz on the second.\n   - Ensure that the amplitude settings are appropriate so that you can clearly see the waveforms on the oscilloscope.\n\n3. **Display Lissajous Figures**:\n   - On the oscilloscope, set it to display both channels (CH1 and CH2) simultaneously in X-Y mode or Lissajous mode.\n   - Observe the pattern displayed on the oscilloscope screen; this is your Lissajous figure.\n\n4. **Analyze Lissajous Figures**:\n   - Change the frequency ratios between the two signals to observe different patterns (e.g., 1:2, 2:3).\n   - For each set of frequencies, note down the observed shape and characteristics of the Lissajous figures.\n   - Use the ratio of frequencies to predict the expected shape and compare it with your observations.\n\n5. **Record Data**:\n   - Take screenshots or photographs of the oscilloscope screen for different frequency combinations.\n   - Make notes on any peculiarities or challenges encountered during the experiment.\n\n### Safety Procedures\n\n1. **Electrical Safety**: \n   - Ensure that all equipment is properly grounded to prevent electrical shocks.\n   - Do not touch exposed electrical components or connectors while devices are powered on.\n\n2. **Proper Handling of Equipment**:\n   - Use only appropriate cables and ensure they are securely connected.\n   - Avoid overloading the power supply by connecting too many devices.\n\n3. **Avoid Overheating**:\n   - Monitor the temperature of the function generators and oscilloscope to avoid overheating, which can damage equipment or pose a fire hazard.\n\n4. **Follow Instructions Carefully**:\n   - Follow all manufacturer instructions for the operation of the oscilloscope and function generators.\n   - Ensure that all adjustments are made with the proper tools (e.g., screwdrivers) and not with bare hands to avoid electrical risks.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully generate and analyze Lissajous figures using an oscilloscope. This experiment is a great way to understand how different frequency ratios affect the appearance of the waveforms on the oscilloscope."
