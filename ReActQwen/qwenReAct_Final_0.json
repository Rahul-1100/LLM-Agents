This is the Lissajous figure.\n   - Adjust the frequencies of both function generators incrementally to see how the shape of the Lissajous figure changes.\n\n5. **Analyze Patterns**:\n   - Note the different shapes (e.g., ellipse, circle, figure-eight) that appear as you vary the frequency ratio between the two signals.\n   - Use known ratios (e.g., 1:2, 3:4) to predict and verify the resulting Lissajous figures.\n\n6. **Record Observations**:\n   - Document the frequency settings for each function generator and describe the corresponding Lissajous figure observed.\n   - Analyze how changes in phase or amplitude affect the shape of the figures.\n\n### Safety Procedures\n\n- **Electrical Safety**: Ensure all equipment is properly grounded to prevent electrical shock. Do not exceed voltage ratings on any device.\n- **Cable Management**: Keep cables organized and away from walkways to avoid tripping hazards.\n- **Equipment Handling**: Handle the oscilloscope and function generators carefully to avoid damage.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully generate and analyze Lissajous figures using an oscilloscope. This experiment helps in understanding waveforms, frequency ratios, and phase relationships between signals."

Use insulated tools when handling electrical components.\n- **Current Limits**: Do not exceed the recommended current limits for your solenoid and power supply to avoid overheating or damage.\n- **Magnetic Field Exposure**: Keep magnetic field sensors away from electronic devices that could be affected by strong magnetic fields.\n- **Supervision**: Conduct the experiment under supervision if you are unfamiliar with handling electrical equipment.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively study the relationship between current and magnetic field strength in a solenoid."
