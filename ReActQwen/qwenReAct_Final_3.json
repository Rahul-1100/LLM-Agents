For example, Channel 1 can be set to 1 kHz.\n   - Set the second function generator (Channel 2) to another frequency. For instance, you might choose 1.5 kHz for Channel 2.\n\n2. **Connecting the Equipment**:\n   - Use BNC cables to connect Channel 1 of the first function generator to the X-axis input terminal of the oscilloscope.\n   - Connect Channel 2 of the second function generator to the Y-axis input terminal of the oscilloscope.\n\n3. **Oscilloscope Configuration**:\n   - Set the oscilloscope's trigger mode to \u201cX-Y\u201d or \"Lissajous\" if available. This will display the waveform as a Lissajous figure.\n   - Adjust the time base and amplitude settings so that you can see the full pattern clearly on the screen.\n\n4. **Observation**:\n   - Observe the resulting Lissajous figure displayed on the oscilloscope\u2019s screen.\n   - Note down the frequency ratio of the two waves (Channel 1/Channel 2). For example, if Channel 1 is at 1 kHz and Channel 2 is at 1.5 kHz, your frequency ratio would be 1:1.5.\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - Analyze the Lissajous figure to determine its geometric characteristics (such as ellipse, circle, line).\n   - Change the phase difference between the two signals by adjusting the phase shift setting on one of the function generators and observe how this affects the shape and orientation of the Lissajous figure.\n   \n6. **Repeat**:\n   - Repeat steps 2 through 5 for different frequency ratios to explore various shapes that can be formed.\n\n7. **Data Collection**:\n   - Record the frequencies, phase differences, and corresponding Lissajous figures for analysis.\n\n### Safety Procedures:\n\n1. **Electrical Safety**: Ensure all equipment is properly grounded and use insulated tools when connecting wires.\n2. **Eye Protection**: Wear safety glasses to protect eyes from any accidental splashes or sparks.\n3. **Proper Handling**: Handle electronic components with care, avoiding direct contact with the circuitry unless necessary.\n\nBy following these steps and precautions, you can successfully generate and analyze Lissajous figures on an oscilloscope using two sinusoidal signals of different frequencies."
