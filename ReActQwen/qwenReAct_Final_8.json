Adjustable power supply preferred for varying current levels.\n- **Ammeter (Current Meter)**: To measure the current flowing through the solenoid.\n- **Gaussmeter or Hall Effect Sensor**: For measuring magnetic field strength inside and outside the solenoid.\n- **Copper Wire**: Insulated wire to connect components.\n- **Connecting Wires**: To connect the power supply, ammeter, and Gaussmeter.\n- **Insulating Tape**: For securing connections.\n- **Safety Goggles**: Essential for safety during experiments.\n\n#### Experiment Steps:\n1. **Setup the Circuit**:\n   - Connect one end of the copper wire to the positive terminal of the power supply.\n   - Connect the other end of this wire to one terminal of the solenoid.\n   - Use another piece of insulated copper wire to connect the other terminal of the solenoid to one terminal of the ammeter.\n   - Finally, connect the second terminal of the ammeter to the negative terminal of the power supply.\n\n2. **Calibration and Safety Check**:\n   - Ensure all connections are secure with insulating tape.\n   - Turn on the power supply and adjust it to a low current level (e.g., 0.5 A).\n\n3. **Measuring Magnetic Field Strength Inside the Solenoid**:\n   - Insert the Gaussmeter or Hall Effect sensor into the center of the solenoid, aligning it along its axis.\n   - Record the magnetic field strength displayed on the Gaussmeter.\n\n4. **Varying Current and Recording Data**:\n   - Increase the current through the power supply in small increments (e.g., 0.5 A intervals up to a maximum safe level).\n   - At each increment, record both the ammeter reading (current) and the corresponding magnetic field strength.\n   \n5. **Measuring Magnetic Field Strength Outside the Solenoid**:\n   - Move the sensor outside the solenoid, ensuring it is at the same distance from the solenoid's axis as when inside.\n   - Record the magnetic field strength outside the solenoid at each current level.\n\n6. **Data Analysis**:\n   - Plot a graph with Magnetic Field Strength on the Y-axis and Current on the X-axis for both inside and outside measurements.\n   - Analyze how the magnetic field varies with current inside the solenoid compared to outside.\n\n7. **Repeat Measurements (Optional)**: \n   - To ensure accuracy, repeat the experiment multiple times under the same conditions and average your results.\n\n#### Safety Procedures:\n- Always wear safety goggles during the experiment to protect against any electrical sparks or components.\n- Ensure all connections are insulated properly to avoid short circuits.\n- Use an adjustable power supply that allows you to control the current safely.\n- Do not touch live components of the circuit with bare hands; use insulated tools when necessary.\n- Keep a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergencies.\n\nThis setup will help verify how magnetic field strength varies with current inside and outside a solenoid, providing insights into the relationship between these variables."
