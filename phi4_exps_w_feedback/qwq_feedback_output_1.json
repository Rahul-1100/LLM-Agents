            "To verify the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit, as expressed by Ohm's Law: V=IRV = IRV=IR": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the materials and procedure for an experiment verifying Ohm's Law. Let me start by looking at the user query again: they want to verify V=IR using a lab setup.\n\nFirst, checking the provided search results from DuckDuckGo. The first link mentions using a wire as a conductor with a power supply, ammeter, voltmeter. The second one talks about Nichrome wire and similar equipment. Another source mentions graphite for resistance. \n\nMaterials: Common elements across sources are a DC power supply, resistors (maybe variable), ammeter, voltmeter, connecting wires, a circuit setup like breadboard or alligator clips. Safety gear like goggles is important too.\n\nProcedure steps should involve setting up the circuit with these components. Maybe varying voltage and measuring current to see if V/I equals R. The second link's procedure mentions plotting V vs I to get a straight line (since V=IR), so that's a good step. Also, changing resistance values might be part of it.\n\nWait, some sources mention using different resistors or adjusting the power supply voltage. Maybe steps should include multiple trials with varying voltages or resistances. Need to ensure measurements are taken accurately. \n\nSafety procedures: Handling electrical components safely, avoiding short circuits, using proper insulation, and maybe not exceeding resistor power ratings. Also, wearing safety glasses.\n\nHmm, putting it all together. The materials list needs the essential items like wires, power supply, meters, resistors. Steps would involve building the circuit, taking measurements at different settings, calculating V/I to see if it's consistent (R). Maybe creating a graph of Voltage vs Current to show linearity with slope as R.\n\nNeed to make sure the procedure is clear step-by-step. Also check if any sources suggest specific steps like using a rheostat for variable resistance or fixed resistors. The third link mentions analog and digital instruments, so maybe include both types? Or just specify that either can be used.\n\nAlso, in the search results, one part mentioned \"Part 1: Ohm's Law\" with setting up circuits starting from positive terminals. So ensuring correct circuit setup is key. \n\nI think the main points are covered. Let me structure this into materials and steps properly, making sure all components are listed and steps are clear, along with safety measures.\n</think>\n\n**Experiment Title:** Verification of Ohm's Law (V = IR)  \n\n---\n\n### **Experiment Materials & Equipment**:  \n1. **Power Supply Unit (DC)**: Adjustable voltage source to vary the potential difference.  \n2. **Resistors**: A selection of resistors (e.g., 5 \u03a9, 10 \u03a9, 15 \u03a9) or a variable resistor/rheostat for varying resistance values.  \n3. **Ammeter**: To measure current in the circuit (ensure it has the appropriate range).  \n4. **Voltmeter**: To measure voltage across the resistor (ensure it is set to the correct scale).  \n5. **Connecting Wires**: Insulated copper wires with banana plugs for circuit connections.  \n6. **Breadboard or Circuit Board**: For organizing components and building the circuit.  \n7. **Alligator Clips**: Optional, for secure wire connections.  \n8. **Multimeter (optional)**: To double-check resistor values or measure voltage/current directly.  \n9. **Safety Gear**: Safety goggles and insulated gloves to prevent electric shock.  \n\n---\n\n### **Experiment Steps**:  \n\n#### **Step 1: Prepare the Circuit**  \n- Assemble a simple series circuit using the breadboard/wires. The circuit should include:  \n  - Power supply (set to a low voltage, e.g., 3\u20136 V initially).  \n  - Resistor (start with a fixed resistor like 10 \u03a9).  \n  - Ammeter in series to measure current (\\(I\\)).  \n  - Voltmeter in parallel across the resistor to measure voltage (\\(V\\)).  \n\n**Circuit Diagram**:  \n```\nPower Supply (+) \u2192 Ammeter \u2192 Resistor \u2192 Power Supply (-)  \nVoltmeter connected across the resistor.  \n```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Calibrate Instruments**  \n- Set the ammeter to a range higher than the expected current (e.g., 0\u2013500 mA).  \n- Set the voltmeter to a range higher than the power supply voltage (e.g., 0\u201310 V).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Collect Data for Fixed Resistance**  \n1. **Adjust Voltage**: Start with the power supply set at 2 V.  \n2. **Measure Values**:  \n   - Record the current (\\(I\\)) shown on the ammeter.  \n   - Record the voltage (\\(V\\)) across the resistor from the voltmeter.  \n3. **Repeat for Multiple Voltages**: Increase the voltage in increments (e.g., 4 V, 6 V) and record \\(I\\) and \\(V\\) each time.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Repeat with Different Resistances**  \n1. Replace the resistor with a different value (e.g., 5 \u03a9 or 15 \u03a9).  \n2. Repeat Step 3 for several voltages to gather data points.  \n3. Use a variable resistor/rheostat if available, adjusting resistance while keeping voltage constant to observe current changes.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5: Calculate and Analyze**  \n- For each trial, calculate \\(R = \\frac{V}{I}\\) (Ohm\u2019s Law).  \n- Compare calculated \\(R\\) with the resistor\u2019s labeled value (e.g., 10 \u03a9 \u00b1 tolerance).  \n- Plot a graph of **Voltage (\\(V\\)) vs. Current (\\(I\\))** for each resistor:  \n  - The slope should equal the resistance (\\(R = \\text{slope}\\)).  \n  - A linear relationship confirms Ohm\u2019s Law holds for ohmic conductors.  \n\n---\n\n### **Safety Procedures**:  \n1. Wear safety goggles to protect against electrical sparks or flying debris.  \n2. Ensure alligator clips and wires are insulated to prevent short circuits.  \n3. Keep the power supply voltage low (\u2264 6 V) to avoid overheating resistors.  \n4. Never touch exposed terminals or components while the circuit is powered.  \n5. Turn off the power supply when adjusting the circuit.  \n\n---\n\n### **Expected Outcome**:  \n- The ratio \\(\\frac{V}{I}\\) should remain constant for a given resistor, verifying \\(R = \\frac{V}{I}\\).  \n- The voltage-current graph will be a straight line through the origin, with its slope equal to resistance.  \n\nThis experiment demonstrates Ohm\u2019s Law and helps understand the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in electrical circuits."
