The turns ratio would be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_p}{N_s} = \\frac{240 \\, \\text{V}}{120 \\, \\text{V}} = 2\n\\]\n\nThis means that there are twice as many turns in the primary winding compared to the secondary winding.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following these detailed steps and ensuring proper safety measures, you can accurately determine the turns ratio of a transformer and verify the relationship between primary and secondary voltages. This process is essential for maintaining the reliability and efficiency of electrical power systems."
