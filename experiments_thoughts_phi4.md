      - Connect the other end of the resistor back to the negative terminal, forming a closed loop.
      - Insert the ammeter in series with the resistor to measure current (I).
      - Connect the voltmeter across the resistor to measure voltage (V).

   2. Start with the lowest resistance value and set the power supply to a low voltage setting.

   3. Gradually increase the voltage while recording the corresponding current readings from the ammeter and voltage readings from the voltmeter.

   4. Calculate the experimental value of \( R \) using \( R = \frac{V}{I} \).

   5. Repeat steps 2-4 for different resistor values to gather multiple data points.

   6. Compare the calculated resistance with the known resistance values to verify Ohm's Law.

5. **Data Analysis:**
   - Plot a graph of voltage (V) against current (I).
   - The slope of the line should equal the resistance \( R \), confirming \( V = IR \).

**Thought 1:** With the experiment planned, I need to ensure that all steps are clear and safety measures are emphasized. This setup will allow for systematic verification of Ohm's Law.
