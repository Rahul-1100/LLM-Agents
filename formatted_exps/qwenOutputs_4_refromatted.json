The experiment will be conducted within safe parameters.\n\nMaterials Required:\n1. Power Supply or Battery (e.g., 9V DC)\n2. Resistors of known values (e.g., 1k\u03a9, 2.2k\u03a9, 4.7k\u03a9)\n3. Ammeter capable of measuring currents up to at least 30mA\n4. Voltmeter capable of measuring voltages up to 30V DC\n5. Wires for circuit connections\n6. Breadboard and jumper wires (optional but useful)\n\nStep-by-Step Procedure:\n\nstep1:\n1. Set up a simple series circuit with one resistor connected to the power supply.\n\nstep2:\n1. Connect the ammeter in series with the resistor for measuring current.\n\nstep3:\n1. Place the voltmeter across the resistor to measure voltage.\n\nstep4:\n1. Measure and record the voltage and current values while keeping the power source constant.\n2. Repeat this step for different resistors, ensuring you vary the resistance in a systematic manner.\n\nstep5:\n1. Calculate the resistance using Ohm's Law (R=V/I) from each set of measurements to verify consistency with the marked values on the resistors.\n\nsafetyNotes:\n1. Ensure that all components are within the safety parameters: voltage levels should not exceed 30V DC, and currents should be kept below 30mA.\n2. Handle electrical components carefully. Ensure the power supply is disconnected before making changes to the circuit.\n"
