Entering service with the United States Navy in 1956 and the Air Force in 1964, the AIM-9 is one of the oldest, cheapest, and most successful air-to-air missiles. Its latest variants remain standard equipment in most Western-aligned air forces. The Soviet K-13 (AA-2 \"Atoll\"), a reverse-engineered copy of the AIM-9B, was also widely adopted.\\nLow-level development started in the late 1940s, emerging in the early 1950s as a guidance system for the modular Zuni rocket. This modularity allowed for the introduction of newer seekers and rocket motors, including the AIM-9C variant, which used semi-active radar homing and served as the basis of the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radar missile. Due to the Sidewinder\\'s infrared guidance system, the brevity code \"Fox two\" is used when firing the AIM-9. Originally a tail-chasing system, early models saw extensive use during the Vietnam War, but had a low success rate (8% hit rate with the AIM-9E variant). This led to all-aspect capability in the L (Lima) version, which proved an effective weapon during the 1982 Falklands War and Operation Mole Cricket 19 in Lebanon. Its adaptability has kept it in service over newer designs like the AIM-95 Agile and SRAAM that were intended to replace it.\\nThe Sidewinder is the most widely used air-to-air missile in the West, with more than 110,000 missiles produced for the U.S. and 27 other nations, of which perhaps one percent have been used in combat. It has been built under license by Sweden and other nations. The AIM-9 has an estimated 270 aircraft kills.\\nIn 2010, Boeing won a contract to support Sidewinder operations through to 2055. In 2021 an Air Force spokesperson said that its relatively low cost, versatility, and reliability mean it is \"very possible that the Sidewinder will remain in Air Force inventories through the late 21st century\".\\n\\nPage: Video camera tube\\nSummary: Video camera tubes are devices based on the cathode-ray tube that were used in television cameras to capture television images, prior to the introduction of charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors in the 1980s. Several different types of tubes were in use from the early 1930s, and as late as the 1990s.\\nIn these tubes, an electron beam is scanned across an image of the scene to be broadcast focused on a target. This generated a current that is dependent on the brightness of the image on the target at the scan point. The size of the striking ray i'},\n",

       "  'wiki': 'Page: Buffer amplifier\\nSummary: In electronics, a buffer amplifier is a unity gain amplifier that copies a signal from one circuit to another while transforming its electrical impedance to provide a more ideal source (with a lower output impedance for a voltage buffer or a higher output impedance for a current buffer). This \"buffers\" the signal source in the first circuit against being affected by currents from the electrical load of the second circuit and may simply be called a buffer or follower when context is clear.\\n\\nPage: Gain–bandwidth product\\nSummary: The gain–bandwidth product (designated as GBWP, GBW, GBP, or GB) for an amplifier is a figure of merit calculated by multiplying the amplifier\\'s bandwidth and the gain at which the bandwidth is measured.\\nFor devices such as operational amplifiers that are designed to have a simple one-pole frequency response, the gain–bandwidth product is nearly independent of the gain at which it is measured; in such devices the gain–bandwidth product will also be equal to the unity-gain bandwidth of the amplifier (the bandwidth within which the amplifier gain is at least 1).\\nFor an amplifier in which negative feedback reduces the gain to below the open-loop gain, the gain–bandwidth product of the closed-loop amplifier will be approximately equal to that of the open-loop amplifier.\\n\"The parameter characterizing the frequency dependence of the operational amplifier gain is the finite gain–bandwidth product (GB).\"\\n\\nPage: Transimpedance amplifier\\nSummary: In electronics, a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is a current to voltage converter, almost exclusively implemented with one or more operational amplifiers. The TIA can be used to amplify the current output of Geiger–Müller tubes, photo multiplier tubes, accelerometers, photo detectors and other types of sensors to a usable voltage.    Current to voltage converters are used with sensors that have a current response that is more linear than the voltage response.   This is the case with photodiodes where it is not uncommon for the current response to have better than 1% nonlinearity over a wide range of light input. The transimpedance amplifier presents a low impedance to the photodiode and isolates it from the output voltage of the operational amplifier.   In its simplest form a transimpedance amplifier has just a large valued feedback resistor, Rf.   The gain of the amplifier is set by this resistor and because the amplifier is in an inverting configuration, has a value of -Rf.  There are several different configurations of transimpedance amplifiers, each suited to a particular application.   The one factor they all have in common is the requirement to convert the low-level current of a sensor to a voltage.   The gain, bandwidth, as well as current and voltage offsets change with different types of sensors, requiring different configurations of transimpedance amplifiers.'}]"

       "Setting up and testing a unity gain amplifier using an IC 741 operational amplifier is a common laboratory exercise in electronics. Below are the required materials and the detailed experiment procedure.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Required Materials:\n",
       "1. **IC 741 Operational Amplifier** - This is the main component that will perform the amplification.\n",
       "2. **Breadboard** - Used to easily connect and test circuits without soldering.\n",
       "3. **DC Power Supply (±15V)** - The IC 741 requires a dual power supply for its operation; ±15V is often recommended.\n",
       "4. **Resistors**: Two resistors of the same value, typically 10kΩ each are used in this setup to ensure unity gain.\n",
       "5. **Potentiometer (optional)** - Can be used if you want to adjust the input signal for testing purposes.\n",
       "6. **Signal Generator** - To provide an AC input signal for testing the amplifier's performance.\n",
       "7. **Oscilloscope** - Essential for measuring and observing the input and output signals.\n",
       "8. **Connecting Wires** - To connect different components on the breadboard.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Experiment Procedure:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Preparation:**\n",
       "   - Assemble all necessary materials before starting your experiment.\n",
       "   - Ensure that you understand how to use an oscilloscope, signal generator, and other electronic equipment in your lab.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Setting Up the Circuit:**\n",
       "   - Insert the IC 741 into the breadboard ensuring that pin 1 (the offset null) is oriented correctly. This will often be marked with a dot or half-moon shape on the component itself.\n",
       "   - Connect pin 4 of the IC to ground (0V).\n",
       "   - Pin 2 should be connected to your input signal through one resistor, and also connect this same resistor from pin 3 (output) back to pin 2. This forms a unity gain buffer configuration where the output is equal in magnitude but in phase with the input.\n",
       "   - Connect pin 7 (+Vcc) to +15V of the DC power supply and pin 8 (-Vcc) to -15V.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Connecting Input Signal:**\n",
       "   - Use your signal generator to produce an AC voltage output, which you will feed into pin 2 (the non-inverting input).\n",
       "   - Adjust the frequency and amplitude as needed for testing purposes.\n",
       "   \n",
       "4. **Testing the Amplifier:**\n",
       "   - Connect the oscilloscope probes:\n",
       "     - One probe on the input signal line just before it reaches IC741's pin 2 to observe the original input signal.\n",
       "     - Another probe on pin 3 of the IC, which is your output signal.\n",
       "   - Observe both signals on the oscilloscope. The goal here is for the amplitude and frequency of the two waveforms to be identical (within a small margin due to real-world component tolerances), indicating that you've achieved unity gain.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Data Recording:**\n",
       "   - Record the input voltage and output voltage values observed using the oscilloscope.\n",
       "   - Note any discrepancies or anomalies in your measurements for further analysis.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Analysis:**\n",
       "   - Compare the input and output signals. Ideally, with a properly constructed circuit, the ratio of the peak-to-peak amplitude of the output signal to that of the input signal should be close to 1 (or unity gain).\n",
       "   - Discuss any variations from expected results considering factors such as component tolerances or environmental noise.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Conclusion:**\n",
       "   - Summarize your findings and discuss the success rate of achieving a unity gain amplifier.\n",
       "   - Reflect on possible improvements for future setups if there were any issues encountered during testing.\n",
       "\n",
