       "3. Observe both input and output signals using an oscilloscope:\n",
       "   - Connect one channel of the oscilloscope to the point where you apply the signal (input).\n",
       "   - Connect another channel to the output (pin 3) of the op-amp.\n",
       "4. Adjust the function generator settings such as frequency, amplitude, and offset if needed to observe the behavior of your amplifier under different conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Step 4: Measurement and Analysis\n",
       "1. Measure both input and output voltages using the oscilloscope to ensure they match (within the range allowed by the op-amp's specifications).\n",
       "2. Analyze waveforms for any distortion or changes in amplitude.\n",
       "3. Record observations about how well the amplifier maintains unity gain under different signal conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Step 5: Safety Precautions\n",
       "1. Ensure that all connections are secure to prevent short circuits.\n",
       "2. Use appropriate power supply voltages; typically, ±15V is safe for an op-amp like the IC 741.\n",
       "3. Be cautious when handling electrical components and always ensure the circuit is powered off before making any physical changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "This experiment provides a basic understanding of operational amplifiers in unity gain configuration and serves as a foundation to explore more complex applications such as non-inverting, inverting amplifiers, or integrators/differentiators."
