Change the resistance in the circuit by either using different resistors or adjusting the length of the conductor if variable resistor is not available.\n6. For each resistance value, record new sets of voltage and current values.\n7. Plot a graph with voltage on the y-axis and current on the x-axis for all recorded data points.\n8.

To validate Kirchhoff\u2019s Current Law (KCL), measure the currents entering and exiting each junction in the circuit using an ammeter or multimeter, ensuring they are equal as per KCL.\n7. Analyze the data collected from voltage and current measurements to understand how well the circuit follows KVL and KCL principles."
