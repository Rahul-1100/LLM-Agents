Here's how you can set up your experiment:\n\n### Experiment Materials\n\n1. **Solenoid**: A coil of wire with multiple turns.\n2. **Power Supply**: Adjustable DC power supply to vary the current through the solenoid.\n3. **Ammeter**: To measure the current flowing through the solenoid.\n4. **Magnetic Field Sensor or Hall Effect Probe**: For measuring the magnetic field strength inside and around the solenoid.\n5. **Iron Core (optional)**: A ferromagnetic material like an iron rod to insert into the solenoid for enhancing the magnetic field.\n6. **Connecting Wires**: To connect the components together.\n7. **Ruler or Measuring Tape**: For measuring distances accurately.\n8. **Data Logger or Computer Interface**: If using a digital sensor, to record and analyze data.\n\n### Experiment Steps\n\n1. **Setup**:\n   - Connect the solenoid to the power supply through an ammeter in series to measure the current flowing through it.\n   - Place the magnetic field sensor inside the solenoid at its center or along its length to measure the magnetic field strength.\n\n2. **Calibration**:\n   - Ensure that your magnetic field sensor is calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions before starting measurements.\n\n3. **Data Collection**:\n   - Set the power supply to a low initial current.\n   - Record the current from the ammeter and the corresponding magnetic field reading from the sensor.\n   - Gradually increase the current in small increments, recording the magnetic field strength at each step until you reach the maximum safe current for your setup.\n\n4. **Repetition with Iron Core**:\n   - Insert an iron core into the solenoid and repeat the measurements to observe changes in the magnetic field strength due to the presence of a ferromagnetic material.\n\n5. **Data Analysis**:\n   - Plot the magnetic field strength against the current for both cases (with and without the iron core).\n   - Analyze how the magnetic field varies with the current, verifying that it is directly proportional as per theoretical predictions.\n\n### Safety Procedures\n\n- **Electrical Safety**: Ensure all connections are secure to prevent short circuits. Use a power supply with an adjustable limit to avoid overheating.\n- **Handling Equipment**: Handle the solenoid and iron core carefully to avoid injury from sharp edges or heavy weights.\n- **Magnetic Field Exposure**: Avoid placing magnetic field sensors near electronic devices that could be affected by strong magnetic fields.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully study the relationship between current and magnetic field strength in a solenoid."
