Here's how to set up and conduct this experiment:\n\n### Experiment Materials\n\n1. **Solenoid**: A coil of wire with many turns.\n2. **Power Supply**: A variable DC power supply or batteries.\n3. **Ammeter**: To measure the current flowing through the solenoid.\n4. **Magnetic Field Sensor**: Such as a Hall effect sensor or a Gaussmeter to measure magnetic field strength.\n5. **Ruler or Measuring Tape**: For measuring distances.\n6. **Connecting Wires**: To connect components.\n7. **Switch**: To control the current flow through the solenoid.\n8. **Data Logger (optional)**: For recording measurements.\n\n### Experiment Steps\n\n1. **Setup**:\n   - Connect the solenoid to the power supply using connecting wires, ensuring that an ammeter is in series to measure the current.\n   - Place the magnetic field sensor at the center of the solenoid where you will take your readings.\n   - Ensure all connections are secure and insulated.\n\n2. **Calibration**:\n   - If using a Hall effect sensor or Gaussmeter, calibrate it according to the manufacturer's instructions to ensure accurate measurements.\n\n3. **Measurement**:\n   - Turn on the power supply and adjust the current through the solenoid.\n   - Record the current from the ammeter.\n   - Measure the magnetic field strength at the center of the solenoid using the sensor.\n   - Repeat this process for different values of current, ensuring that each measurement is taken with the system stabilized.\n\n4. **Data Collection**:\n   - Collect data for various currents and corresponding magnetic field strengths.\n   - Ensure to take multiple readings for each current value to improve accuracy and account for any anomalies.\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - Plot a graph of magnetic field strength (B) against current (I).\n   - Analyze the relationship, which should ideally be linear according to Ampere's Law: \\( B = \\mu_0 n I \\), where \\( \\mu_0 \\) is the permeability of free space and \\( n \\) is the number of turns per unit length.\n\n### Safety Procedures\n\n- **Electrical Safety**: Ensure all electrical connections are secure to prevent short circuits. Use insulated tools when handling live wires.\n- **Equipment Handling**: Handle the solenoid and sensors carefully to avoid damage.\n- **Current Limits**: Do not exceed the current rating of the solenoid or power supply to prevent overheating.\n- **Supervision**: Conduct the experiment under supervision if you are inexperienced with electrical equipment.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively study the magnetic field produced by a solenoid and verify its relationship with the electric current."
