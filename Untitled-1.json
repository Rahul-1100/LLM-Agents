It begins with mathematical expressions for the magnetic field in cylindrical coordinates, highlighting the central role of Bessel functions in describing these fields. The analysis reveals that the circular component of the magnetic field is zero due to the use of uniform cylindrical equivalent current in the model. This simplification allows for a focus on the axial and radial components, which are crucial for understanding solenoid behavior. The article further discusses how symmetry considerations simplify calculations along the axis (r = 0), where only the axial component remains significant. A detailed derivation is provided for the axial magnetic field at the center of the solenoid, using a uniform current model. This derivation underscores the practical implications of theoretical models in predicting solenoid behavior under various conditions. The article concludes by emphasizing that while certain components are negligible or zero due to symmetry and modeling choices, understanding these aspects is vital for applications involving solenoids in electromagnetic devices.",

For Sol-1, with a larger inner radius relative to the input beam radius, the beam size can be reduced significantly, achieving a minimum of 0.01 mm. In contrast, Sol-2, which has a smaller ratio between the solenoid's inner radius and the input beam radius, results in a less effective reduction, with a minimum beam size around 0.2 mm. The study emphasizes that not only the focusing constant (Cs) but also this ratio plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of beam size reduction.
