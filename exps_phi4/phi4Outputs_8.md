# 20 To verify the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit, as expressed by Ohm's Law: V=IRV = IRV=IR
Thought 0**Thought 0:** To verify the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) as expressed by Ohm's Law \( V = IR \), I need to design an experiment that safely measures these quantities in a circuit. The experiment should include steps for setting up the circuit, measuring each variable, and ensuring safety parameters are met.

**Plan:**

1. **Gather Materials:**
   - Resistors of known resistance
   - Variable power supply or batteries
   - Ammeter (to measure current)
   - Voltmeter (to measure voltage)
   - Connecting wires
   - Breadboard or circuit board

2. **Safety Considerations:**
   - Ensure all equipment is rated for the voltages and currents used.
   - Use insulated tools to prevent accidental short circuits.
   - Keep water and flammable materials away from the setup.

3. **Experiment Steps:**

   1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
      - Connect a resistor of known resistance \( R \) in series with an ammeter on the circuit board or breadboard.
      - Connect a voltmeter across the resistor to measure voltage drop.
      - Connect the power supply to provide current through the circuit.

   2. **Measure Voltage and Current:**
      - Set the power supply to a low initial voltage.
      - Gradually increase the voltage in small increments.
      - For each increment, record the voltage \( V \) across the resistor using the voltmeter.
      - Record the current \( I \) through the circuit using the ammeter.

   3. **Calculate and Verify Ohm's Law:**
      - Calculate the expected voltage for each measured current using \( V = IR \).
      - Compare the calculated voltages with the measured voltages to verify Ohm's Law.

4. **Repeat Measurements:**
   - Repeat the measurements for different resistors or at different power supply settings to ensure consistency and reliability of results.

5. **Analyze Data:**
   - Plot \( V \) versus \( I \) on a graph.
   - The slope of the line should equal the resistance \( R \), confirming Ohm's Law.

6. **Document Observations:**
   - Note any discrepancies or anomalies in measurements.
   - Ensure all safety protocols were followed throughout the experiment.

**Output Required:**

- List of materials and equipment
- Detailed step-by-step procedure
- Safety precautions
- Data collection method
- Analysis plan (e.g., graphing results)
- Observations and conclusions

By following this structured approach, the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance can be effectively verified while ensuring safety throughout the experiment.
