3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Plot the voltage vs. time graph for the discharge phase.
   - The discharging curve should follow \( V(t) = V_0 \times e^{-t/\tau} \).

### Conclusion:
- Compare the experimental time constant (\(\tau\)) from both charging and discharging phases with the theoretical value calculated using \(\tau = R \times C\).
- Discuss any discrepancies and potential sources of error, such as resistance in wires or measurement inaccuracies.

By following these steps, you can effectively investigate the behavior of a capacitor in an RC circuit and understand the concept of the time constant.
