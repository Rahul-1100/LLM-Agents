# 20 To verify the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit, as expressed by Ohm's Law: V=IRV = IRV=IR
Thought 0**Thought 0:** To verify Ohm's Law (V = IR), I need to design an experiment that measures voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit. The experiment should be safe and include all necessary equipment.

### Experiment Plan

1. **Objective:**
   - Verify the relationship V = IR using practical measurements.

2. **Equipment Required:**
   - Power supply (variable DC source)
   - Resistors of known values
   - Ammeter (to measure current, I)
   - Voltmeter (to measure voltage, V)
   - Connecting wires
   - Breadboard or circuit board

3. **Safety Considerations:**
   - Ensure the power supply is set to a safe voltage level (e.g., below 12V).
   - Use resistors with appropriate power ratings to prevent overheating.
   - Double-check all connections before powering the circuit.

4. **Experimental Steps:**

   1. **Setup the Circuit:**
      - Connect the resistor in series with the ammeter and power supply.
      - Connect the voltmeter across the resistor to measure voltage drop.

   2. **Measurements:**
      - Set the power supply to a low initial voltage (e.g., 1V).
      - Record the current (I) from the ammeter and the voltage (V) from the voltmeter.
      - Increase the voltage in small increments (e.g., 1V steps) up to a safe maximum.
      - For each voltage setting, record the corresponding current.

   3. **Data Collection:**
      - Repeat measurements for different resistors with known resistance values.
      - Record all data systematically in a table format.

5. **Analysis:**
   - Calculate the theoretical current using I = V/R for each measurement.
   - Compare experimental current values with calculated ones to verify Ohm's Law.
   - Plot V vs. I and check if the graph is linear, indicating V = IR.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Analyze the data to confirm the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.
   - Discuss any discrepancies and potential sources of error.

**Thought 1:** The experiment plan is complete with all necessary steps and safety considerations outlined.
