# 20 To verify the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit, as expressed by Ohm's Law: V=IRV = IRV=IR
Thought 0**Thought 0:** To verify Ohm's Law (V = IR), I need to design an experiment that measures voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit. The experiment should be safe and include all necessary materials and steps.

### Experiment Plan

#### Objective:
Verify the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) as expressed by Ohm's Law: \( V = IR \).

#### Materials Required:
- Power supply (variable DC power source)
- Resistors of known values
- Ammeter (to measure current, I)
- Voltmeter (to measure voltage, V)
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard or circuit board
- Safety goggles

#### Safety Parameters:
1. Ensure all equipment is in good working condition.
2. Use resistors within the power rating to prevent overheating.
3. Do not exceed the maximum voltage and current ratings of the ammeter and voltmeter.
4. Wear safety goggles to protect eyes from potential sparks or component failures.

#### Experimental Steps:

1. **Setup the Circuit:**
   - Connect the variable DC power supply, resistor, ammeter, and voltmeter on a breadboard or circuit board as follows:
     - Connect the positive terminal of the power supply to one end of the resistor.
     - Connect the other end of the resistor to the negative terminal of the power supply, completing the circuit.
     - Place the ammeter in series with the resistor to measure current (I).
     - Place the voltmeter across the resistor to measure voltage (V).

2. **Measurements:**
   - Set the power supply to a low initial voltage.
   - Gradually increase the voltage and record the corresponding current (I) from the ammeter and voltage (V) from the voltmeter for each setting.
   - Use different resistors of known resistance values (R) and repeat the measurements.

3. **Data Collection:**
   - Record the values of V, I, and R in a table format.
   - Ensure multiple readings are taken at each voltage level to ensure accuracy.

4. **Verification:**
   - Calculate \( IR \) for each set of measurements.
   - Compare the calculated \( IR \) with the measured voltage (V).
   - Verify that \( V \approx IR \) within experimental error limits.

5. **Analysis:**
   - Plot a graph of Voltage (V) against Current (I) for each resistor.
   - The slope of the line should be equal to the resistance (R), confirming Ohm's Law.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Analyze the data and graphs to conclude whether the experimental results support Ohm's Law.

#### Observations:
- Ensure all measurements are consistent and repeatable.
- Note any discrepancies and potential sources of error, such as contact resistance or instrument precision limits.

By following these steps, you can safely verify Ohm's Law in an electrical circuit.
